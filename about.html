    <h1> Dzhamshed Shoismatuloev </h1>
    <p>My name is Dzhamshed Shoismatuloev. Everyone knows me as a Dzhama. I was born in Tajikistan. In the city of Dushanbe in 1989, at that time Tajikistan was part of the Soviet Union which makes me fluent in Tajik and Russian languages. I attended russian high school in Dushanbe named after A.Pushkin. I was always passionate about computers and web. I'm a person with a lot of different interests and hobby's. </p>
    <p> I was young and driven and I needed something new, while studying in University to become an engineer I decided try to test myself outside of my motherland. 2011 is the year when I move to USA. American life was and still is great for me.
    I started as a lifeguard in Virginia, but couldn't see myself doing that for a long time, so I moved to New York.
    Here where the dreams can come true. Where you can be succesful in any field you want if you want it. As people say if you gonna make it here in NYC, you gonna make it anywhere. 
    Here I acquired many skills from installing central air conditioning system to learning the restaurant business from head to toe. 
    Like I mentioned before I am very passionate about web developing and entrepreneurship. </p>
